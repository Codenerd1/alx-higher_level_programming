How to use 5 - text_indentation.py
== == == == == == == == == == == == == == == ==

This module defines a text - identation function ''text_identation(text)''

Usage
== == =

Text is printed with a new line after each of the following charachters
''.'', '': '' and ''?''

:

    >> > text_identation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
    >> > text_indentation("How are you?")
    How are you
    <BLANKLINE >

No spaces are printed at the beginning of a line.

:

    >> > text_indentation("	How are you?")
    How are you
    <BLANKLINE >

:

    >> > text_indentation("		")

similarly, no spaces are printed at the end of a line.

:

    >> > text_indentation("	How are you?	My name is Job.	")
    How are you
    <BLANKLINE >
    My name is Job
    <BLANKLINE >

Texts that dont end with either charachters: ''.'', '': '' and ''?'' are
not ended with a new line.

:

    >> > text_indentation("Have you been arrested before? I dont think so")
    Have you been arrested before
    <BLANKLINE >
    I dont think so

New lines within a string are printed as normal.

:

    >> > text_indentation("Have you been arrested before? I dont think so\n")
    Have you been arrested before
    <BLANKLINE >
    I dont think so
    <BLANKLINE >

:

    >> > text_indentation("\n\n\n i think you needed three new lines.")
    <BLANKLINE >
    <BLANKLINE >
    <BLANKLINE >
    i think you needed three new lines
    <BLANKLINE >

:

    >> > text_indentation("You are a sneaky \n new line")
    You are a sneaky
    <BLANKLINE >
    new line
